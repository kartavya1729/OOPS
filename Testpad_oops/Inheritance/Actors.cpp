// Design a class Person and two sub classes Actor and Actress. Every Actor will have a name, color, number_of_eyes & debut_year associated with him/her.
// Supply each with a constructor that sets the Person data Ô¨Åelds as described with given values, and a method named toString() that returns a string that contains a complete description of the Actor.
// The constructor should be in the following format

// Actor(name,color,number_of_eyes,debut_year)
// And the same for class Actress.

// Sample input
// Amitabh
// BROWN
// 2
// 1965
// Hema
// White
// 2
// 1975

// Sample output
// The person Amitabh is an Actor. He is BROWN in color, has 2 eyes and debut in 1965
// The person Hema is an Actress. She is White in color, has 2 eyes and debut in 1975
